## Technology Stack

### Core Frameworks
- **SwiftUI**: Apple's modern UI framework for building native iOS interfaces
- **Foundation**: Apple's foundational framework providing essential data types and collections
- **Combine**: Apple's reactive programming framework (prepared for future networking features)

### Development Tools
- **Xcode**: Apple's integrated development environment
- **Swift**: Apple's programming language for iOS development
- **Git**: Version control system for source code management

### Open Source Acknowledgments

This project is built entirely using Apple's native frameworks and tools. No external open source libraries are currently integrated, making it a pure Swift/SwiftUI implementation. This approach ensures:

- **Maximum Performance**: Direct use of Apple's optimized frameworks
- **Long-term Stability**: No dependency on third-party libraries that may become outdated
- **Native User Experience**: Full integration with iOS design patterns and behaviors
- **Minimal Maintenance**: Reduced risk of breaking changes from external dependencies

### Future Open Source Considerations

As the app evolves, we may consider integrating the following open source libraries:

- **Networking**: For API communication with fanfiction platforms
- **Image Loading**: For efficient cover image caching and loading
- **Database**: For local story caching and offline reading
- **Analytics**: For understanding user behavior and app performance
